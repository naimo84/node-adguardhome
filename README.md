## :question: Get Help

For bug reports and feature requests, open issues. :bug:

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications _for free_! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

Thank you to all my backers!

### Become a backer

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

- Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
- [![PayPal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge)][paypal-donations] &nbsp; — &nbsp; You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
- [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/T6T412CXA) &nbsp;—&nbsp; I'll buy a ~~tea~~ coffee. :coffee: :wink:


Thanks! :heart:
